# Reveal Hidden Customer Insights  
*Unsupervised NLP Analysis of Feedback Data*  
**Built with Python, Streamlit, and Coffee-fueled Persistence ☕**

## What's the build? (And Why It Matters)

**The Problem:**  
Businesses drown in customer feedback but struggle to find actionable patterns. Traditional methods either:  
- Miss hidden themes (fixed categories)  
- Take weeks to analyze (manual processing)

**Our Solution:**  
An AI-powered tool that:
1. **Automatically clusters** feedback into emerging themes
2. **Labels topics** like "Login Issues" or "Delivery Delays"
3. **Scores sentiment** per cluster
4. **Alerts** on critical issues

*Real impact: Reduced analysis time from weeks → minutes for 10K+ reviews*

## How was it Built  - The Technical Journey

### 🔧 Core Technologies
Python 3.10, Streamlit, spaCy, scikit-learn, TextBlob, Gensim, Altair, VADER


### 🛠️ Key Components
1. **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**
   - Stripped URLs/emojis, lemmatized text ("running" → "run")
   - *Challenge:* Handling messy real-world data (e.g., "Th!s app sux!!")

2. **Cluster Engine**
   - TF-IDF vectorization → KMeans clustering
   - *Aha Moment:* Switched from LDA to KMeans for faster processing

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Started with TextBlob, upgraded to VADER for slang handling
   - *Gotcha:* Initial version misclassified sarcasm 😅

4. **Dynamic Aspect Detection**
   - Semantic matching using spaCy vectors
   - *User Control:* Adjust similarity threshold in UI

5. **Streamlit Dashboard**
   - Interactive cluster explorer with word clouds
   - *Pro Tip:* Used Altair for responsive charts
